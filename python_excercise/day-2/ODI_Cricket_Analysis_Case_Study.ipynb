**Breaking Down the Code Logic**\n","1. **`odi['Runs'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >= 100 else 0)`**\n","   - This uses a **lambda function**, which is an **anonymous function** in Python.\n","   - It checks if the `Runs` column contains values **greater than or equal to 100**.\n","   - If the condition is met, it assigns **1** (indicating a century); otherwise, it assigns **0**.\n","\n","2. **Applying Lambda Functions for Other Categories**\n","   - Similarly, the same approach is used for:\n","     - `Fifty` → Runs between **50 and 99**.\n","     - `Duckouts` → Runs equal to **0**.\n","     - `Nervous90s` → Runs between **95 and 99**.\n","\n","3. **Why Use `apply(lambda x: ...)` Instead of `for` Loops?**\n","   - The `.apply()` function is **vectorized**, making it much **faster and more efficient** than iterating through each row using `for` loops.\n","   - It applies the function to each row of the **Runs** column efficiently.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Example Output**\n","|
