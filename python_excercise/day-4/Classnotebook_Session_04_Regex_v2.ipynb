Regular expressions are used to replace text within a string, validate forms, extract a substring from a string based on a pattern match, and so much more.

| Matches **one or more** occurrences of the previous character | `ca+t` → matches `cat`, `caaat` but not `ct` |\n","| `^`  | Matches at the **start** of a string and negation| `^Hello` → matches `\"Hello world\"`, but not `\"world Hello\"` |\n","| `$`  | Matches at the **end** of a string | `world$` → matches `\"Hello world\"`, but not `\"world Hello\"` |\n","| `[]` | Matches **one** of the set of characters within brackets | `[aeiou]` → matches any vowel in a word |\n","| `[a-z]` | Matches **one** lowercase letter from `a` to `z` | `[a-z]` → matches `a, b, c, ..., z` |\n","| `[^abc]` | Matches **any character except** `a`, `b`, or `c` | `[^abc]` → matches `d, e, f, ...` |\n","| `{n,m}` | Matches at **least `n` but not more than `m`** occurrences of the preceding character | `a{2,4}`
